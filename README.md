## How to run the script (SOR_SCRIPT.py):

1) Clone this repository to your local machine
2) In your command line, cd into the repository
3) Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in command line
4) Run 'python3 SOR_SCRIPT.py' in command line
5) Enter the folder path to your text files when prompted
6) Enter the file path to your metadata when prompted

The script will then create the final dataset, download the csv & json files to your current working directory and return some statistics on the number of entities identified!

`See the last section of the SOR_DEMO file for complete instructions and an example of running the script.`
